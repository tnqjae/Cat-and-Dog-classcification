<h1>Project name: Cat and Dog Classification</h1>
This repository is the first project of the AI ​​team of the Apex club of the Department of Computer Security Engineering at Myongji University.

<h1>Project Description</h1>
This Project is Basic AI project.
Cat and Dog image classification using VGG-16 and ResNet-50

We implement basic model architecture. And we used transfer learning to improve model performance.

<h1>File Description</h1>

model.pth => VGG-16 pth file
ResNet_CatandDog_classification.pth => ResNet-50 pth file

model_server.py, model_server_resnet50.py => flask server

test.py => test flask server

mainpage.html => test Page

<h1>Dataset</h1>
We use Cat and dog dataset from Kaggle
