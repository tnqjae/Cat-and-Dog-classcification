#Project name: Cat and Dog Classification
This repository is the first project of the AI â€‹â€‹team of the Apex club of the Department of Computer Security Engineering at Myongji University.

#Project Description
This Project is Basic AI project.
Cat and Dog image classification using VGG-16 and ResNet-50

We implement basic model architecture. And we used transfer learning to improve model performance.
